# Age Classification

This project performs age classification using machine learning. The model is trained to predict the age group based on given input features.

## Project Structure
- `Age_Classification.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing the code for training and evaluating the model.
- `requirements.txt` - List of dependencies required to run the project.
- `.gitignore` - Specifies files and folders to be ignored by Git.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/age-classification.git
   cd age-classification
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
